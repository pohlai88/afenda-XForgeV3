# 07 — Report and annotate

The output shape for every review, and the Figma annotation spec. Read this in both review
modes.

## Contents

- [Report sections](#report-sections)
- [Scope and Coverage](#scope-and-coverage)
- [Findings](#findings)
- [Strengths](#strengths)
- [Considered but Rejected](#considered-but-rejected)
- [Verification](#verification)
- [Verdict](#verdict)
- [Annotating a Figma frame](#annotating-a-figma-frame)

## Report sections

Always in this order:

1. Scope and Coverage
2. Findings
3. Strengths
4. Considered but Rejected
5. Verification
6. Verdict

A consistency audit substitutes its own body sections (see `06-review-consistency.md`) for
section 2, and keeps the rest.

## Scope and Coverage

State the mode (`quick` / `full`), the exact scope, the stack and styling conventions, and
any review boundary. Then a coverage table:

| Domain | Evidence inspected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility | Files, components, states, or checks | Findings count or `Clear` |

Include every domain you were meant to cover. `Clear` means inspected with no actionable
finding. `Not reviewed` must explain why. Never imply an uninspected surface was reviewed.

## Findings

One table, ordered by severity, then by reach and leverage.

| # | Severity | Domain | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | HIGH | Accessibility | `src/Dialog.tsx:42` | `<button><XIcon /></button>` | Add `aria-label="Close"` and hide the icon from the accessibility tree | The icon-only control has no accessible name |

- **What** — the specific issue, naming the exact element, layer, or file and line.
- **Why** — the craft or usability reason, in one line.
- **After** — a concrete change with an exact value. "Increase spacing" is not a fix;
  "16px → 24px between the group and the heading" is.

Rules:

- One row per **root cause**. List every confirmed location in that row rather than
  emitting a row per occurrence.
- Respect the mode's finding cap. Never pad to reach it.
- Lead with the few findings that matter. Don't list everything you noticed.
- When two domains cover the same issue, file it under the domain that owns the underlying
  rule and mention the secondary effect in *Why*.
- If there are no findings, omit the table and write "No actionable interface findings."

## Strengths

Two to four things done well, specifically. Critique builds on what works, and a report
with no strengths section reads as an attack rather than a review.

Close this section with **the single highest-leverage change to make first**.

## Considered but Rejected

Candidates you inspected and deliberately did not raise. A candidate is rejected when the
principle permits the current implementation, evidence is insufficient, the project
convention is intentional, or the change would add complexity without user benefit.

Include 1–3 in `quick` mode, 2–5 in `full`.

| Location | Candidate | Rejected because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/Card.tsx:28` | Increase the shadow | Existing depth matches the shared surface token; changing one card would reduce consistency |

These are real candidates, not invented filler. If the scope genuinely contained fewer
borderline cases, include the ones that exist and say so.

## Verification

Run safe, relevant checks available in the project. Inspect the rendered interface when
runtime behavior or visual judgment matters. List each check or interaction, the exact
command or steps, and the observed result.

Separate checks that passed from checks marked **Not verified**. Never convert a
verification gap into a finding — "I couldn't test this" is not the same as "this is
broken."

## Verdict

Exactly one:

- **`Block`** — one or more HIGH findings remain.
- **`Needs changes`** — only MEDIUM or LOW findings remain.
- **`Approve`** — no actionable findings remain **and** the claimed coverage was verified.

## Annotating a Figma frame

When the review target is a Figma frame, every findings row also lands on the canvas as a
card.

Cards go on one top-level layer named `Interface review`, in the empty space to the left
and right of the frame — never on top of the design, never overlapping the frame's own
titles or chrome.

**Never reparent, edit, lock, or restyle the frames under review.** Annotations are
additive; the review is otherwise read-only.

### Card anatomy

A vertical auto-layout frame: `280px` fixed width, height hugging contents, `12px` padding,
`8px` item spacing, `8px` corner radius, `oklch(1 0 0)` fill, `1px oklch(0 0 0 / 0.08)`
stroke.

Three stacked children, in order:

1. **Severity pill** — hug-width rounded rect, `4px` radius, `2px` vertical and `6px`
   horizontal padding, filled per the table below. Label is the severity word in uppercase,
   `9px`, weight `600`, `0.04em` letter-spacing.
2. **Title** — `#4 CTA contrast`. Finding number, then a three-to-five-word summary.
   `12px`, weight `600`, `oklch(0.15 0 0)`.
3. **Body** — one or two sentences: what is wrong, then what to do. `11px`, weight `400`,
   line-height `1.4`, `oklch(0.45 0 0)`. Cap at 240 characters; full reasoning stays in the
   table.

| Severity | Pill fill | Pill text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HIGH | `oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)` red | `oklch(1 0 0)` white |
| MEDIUM | `oklch(0.705 0.213 47.604)` orange | `oklch(0.15 0 0)` near-black |
| LOW | `oklch(0.852 0.199 91.936)` yellow | `oklch(0.15 0 0)` near-black |

White on orange and yellow measures below 4.5:1 — use the near-black. The pill names the
severity in words, so color never carries it alone and no legend is needed.

### Building the card

Hug sizing is not the default, and children only participate in auto-layout once appended.
Follow this sequence exactly:

```js
await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Inter", style: "Semi Bold" });
await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: "Inter", style: "Regular" });

const card = figma.createFrame();
card.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";            // must come before any sizing property
card.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";     // hug height
card.counterAxisSizingMode = "FIXED";    // fixed width
card.resize(280, card.height);
card.verticalPadding = 12;
card.horizontalPadding = 12;
card.itemSpacing = 8;

// Children must be appended to the card. Creating a node and setting its
// x/y puts it on the canvas as a sibling: the card then hugs to nothing
// and its contents float outside the frame.
card.appendChild(pill);
card.appendChild(title);
card.appendChild(body);

// Text wraps to the card width and grows downward
for (const text of [title, body]) {
  text.layoutAlign = "STRETCH";
  text.textAutoResize = "HEIGHT";
}

// The pill hugs its own label instead of stretching
pill.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
pill.primaryAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
pill.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO";
pill.layoutAlign = "INHERIT";
pillLabel.textAutoResize = "WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT";

// x and y are ignored on auto-layout children. Position the card only.
card.x = gutterX;
card.y = stackY;
```

Load every font with `figma.loadFontAsync` before setting `characters`. Text set with an
unloaded font measures at zero, so the card hugs to nothing.

Gate on the result before positioning anything else:

```js
if (card.children.length !== 3 || card.height < 56) {
  throw new Error(
    `Finding ${n}: card built empty — ${card.children.length} children, ${card.height}px tall`
  );
}
```

A correctly built card is at least `56px` tall. Anything near `26px` is padding with no
content between.

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| Card hugs to ~26px with contents floating outside | Children created but never `appendChild`ed |
| Every card is the same height | `primaryAxisSizingMode` left at `FIXED` |
| Card is as wide as its longest line | `counterAxisSizingMode` left at `AUTO` |
| Body text runs off the card on one line | Text missing `layoutAlign = "STRETCH"` and `textAutoResize = "HEIGHT"` |
| Pill spans the full card width | Pill missing `AUTO` sizing on both axes |
| Children ignore the positions you set | Expected — auto-layout owns child position; set `x`/`y` on the card only |

### Placement

Two gutters: one starting `80px` left of the frame, one `80px` right. Assign each card to
the gutter nearer its target node, then within a gutter sort by the target's vertical
position and stack top to bottom with `16px` between cards. If a stack would run past the
frame's bottom edge, move the overflow to the other gutter rather than shrinking cards or
letting them overlap.

Position cards only after all children are appended and sized — a card's final height isn't
known until then.

Draw a `1.5px` dashed connector from the card's inner edge to the target node's nearest
edge, stroked in that finding's severity color, routed as a single elbow: horizontal out of
the card, then horizontal into the node. End it with a `4px` dot on the node, not an
arrowhead. A finding spanning the whole flow gets no connector.

Group the card and connector for one finding and name it `#4 MEDIUM Layout`.

### Scale

These values assume a frame between `1000px` and `1600px` wide. Outside that range,
multiply every annotation dimension and type size by `frameWidth / 1400` so cards stay
readable at the zoom level where the whole frame fits on screen.

### Re-running

Delete the existing `Interface review` layer before drawing the new one. Annotations
replace; they never stack. If the file is view-only, or the user asked for the report only,
output the table alone and say the frame was not annotated.
